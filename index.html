	Buffett serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.
	He is considered by some to be one of the most successful investors in the world and as of August 2017 is 
	the second wealthiest person in the United States, and the fourth wealthiest in the world,
	with a total net worth of $81.1 billion. </p>

	<div class="panel">  
	<img src="images/caesar.jpg" alt="Julius Caesar" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> 
	<p>Caesar was born into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary 
	Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. The family originated from Alba Longa, twenty miles south of Rome.
	The cognomen "Caesar" originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by Caesarean section. 
	The Historian Augusta suggests three alternative explanations: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin caesaries); that he had bright grey eyes 
	(Latin oculis caesiis); or that he killed an elephant (caesai in Moorish) in battle. 
	Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favoured this interpretation of his name.</p>
	<p>In 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly, so Caesar was the head of the family at 16. His coming of age coincided 
	with a civil war between his uncle Gaius Marius and his rival Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Both sides carried out bloody
	purges of their political opponents whenever they were in the ascendancy. Marius and his ally Lucius Cornelius Cinna 
	were in control of the city when Caesar was nominated to be the new high priest of Jupiter, and he was married to Cinna's 
	daughter Cornelia. Following Sulla's final victory, though, Caesar's connections to the old regime made him a target for the new one.
	He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry, and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. 
	The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins.
	Sulla gave in reluctantly, and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar. </p>

	<p>Cleopatra VII Philopator born 69 BC known to history simply as Cleopatra, was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom
	of Egypt, briefly survived as pharaoh by her son Caesarion. After her reign, Egypt became a province of the recently established Roman Empire.</p>
	<p>Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Greek family of Macedonian origin that ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great's death during 
	the Hellenistic period. The Ptolemies spoke Greek throughout their dynasty, and refused to speak Late Egyptian, which is the reason that Greek as well as 
	Egyptian were used on official court documents such as the Rosetta Stone. By contrast, Cleopatra did learn to speak Egyptian and represented herself as the reincarnation of the Egyptian goddess Isis.
	Cleopatra originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes, and later with her brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, whom she married as per Egyptian custom, but eventually she became sole ruler.
	As queen, she consummated a liaison with Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. 
	She later elevated Caesarion, her son with Caesar, to co-ruler in name. </p>

	<p>Nicholas Culpeper probably born at Ockley, Surrey, 18 October 1616 – died at Spitalfields, London, 10 January 1654 was an English botanist, herbalist, physician, and astrologer. His published books includes 
	The English Physitian (1652), i. e. the Complete Herbal (1653 ff), which contains a rich store of pharmaceutical and herbal knowledge, and Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick (1655),
	which is one of the most detailed documents known on the practice of medical astrology in Early Modern Europe. </p>
	<p>Culpeper spent the greater part of his life in the English outdoors cataloguing hundreds of medicinal herbs. He criticized what he considered the unnatural methods of his contemporaries, writing: 
	"This not being pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, Dr. Reason and Dr. Experience, and took a voyage to visit my mother Nature, by whose advice, together with the help of 
	Dr. Diligence, I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by Mr. Honesty, a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it. Culpeper came from a long line of notable people including 
	Thomas Culpeper, the lover of Catherine Howard (also a distant relative), who was sentenced to death by Catherine's husband, King Henry VIII. </p>

	<p>Richard Phillips Feynman born May 11, 1918 was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path 
	integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity
	of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions 
	to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. </p>
	<p>Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behaviour of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams.
	During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide
	by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time. He assisted in the development 
	of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, 
	the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, 
	Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. 
	He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology. </p>

   	<img src="images/parks.jpg" alt="Rosa Parks" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
	<p>Rosa Louise McCauley Parks born February 4, was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement, whom the United States Congress called "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement". 
	On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks refused to obey bus driver James F. Blake's order to give up her seat in the "colored section" to a white passenger, after the whites-only section was filled. 
	Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation.  </p>
	<p>Others had taken similar steps, including Bayard Rustin in 1942, Irene Morgan in 1946, Lillie Mae Bradford in 1951, Sarah Louise Keys in 1952, and the members of the ultimately 
	successful Browder v. Gayle 1956 lawsuit (Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith) 
	who were arrested in Montgomery for not giving up their bus seats months before Parks. NAACP organizers believed that 
	Parks was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating
	Alabama segregation laws, although eventually her case became bogged down in the state courts while 
	the Browder v. Gayle case succeeded. Parks' act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important
	symbols of the modern Civil Rights Movement. She became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. 
	She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including Edgar Nixon, president of the local chapter of 
	the NAACP; and Martin Luther King, Jr., a new minister in town who gained national prominence in the civil rights movement.</p>

    <div class="panel">  
   	<img src="images/aristotle.jpg" alt="Aristotle" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
	<p>Aristotle 384BC was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern
	periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus 
	became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until 
	the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics,
	logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, politics and 
	government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, 
	Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. </p>
	<p>Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies.
	He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, 
	which were written on papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former 
	views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from 
	Platonism to empiricism. He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. 
	Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works. </p>
	<p>Aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. 
	Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not 
	replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. Some of Aristotle's 
	zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyli (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were not confirmed or 
	refuted until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, 
	which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic. </p>

	campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He is the middle of 
	three sons (his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and director and his younger brother, John, was an executive

	<p>Neil Alden Armstrong August 5, 1930 was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first person to walk on the Moon. 
	He was also an aerospace engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, 
	Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at 
	Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed 
	Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California. </p>
	<p>A participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, 
	Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966,
	becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, 
	with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to prevent a 
	dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency. Armstrong's second and last 
	spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module
	Pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael
	Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the 
	Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional 
	Space Medal of Honour in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009. </p>
